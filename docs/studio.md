# Studio mode #

Studio Mode is a very useful tool for streaming. It allows users to change the scenes in the background without being seen by your viewers.

**1.** Click the **Studio Mode** button on the right corner of your program window. You can add the scene and sources by clicking the plus button on the left corner of the main screen.

Two panels will be presenting on the screen. The left panel is your preview scene and the right panel presents the scene that is showing on live scene.

 Preview scene is editable when you are streaming. Hence, you can always make changes to it until you feel you are ready to present. For this part of the instruction, I have two scenes, one is Google home page on the browser and the other one is the image. 

 In order to show the content on the live scene (on the right), we need to upload the content on the preview scene (left scene) first and then switch to the right. We will go through how to do this with you now. Suppose we want to show **Scene1** on the live mode, we first need to upload it to the preview mode.

**2.** Select the scene you would like to show on the live mode. Then, click on  the "eye" icon side the source you like to choose. The scene, which is a Google ho,e panel will show up on the left scene now.

**3.** Select the **Transition** button in the middle of the screen. Then your the Google browser will display on the live move (right).

Now, think about the image you want to present on the **Preview** mode. For this instruction, we will work choose Scene2 which will display some images.

**4.** Choose the **Scene2**, and select both the "eye" icon beside **Image**. Then, a cartoon image shows on the preview panel.

**5.** Click on **Start Streaming**

 Now we are live streaming sharing the Google browser on the right panel, the cartoon image is still on the edit position.
 If we want to present two images on the preview screen to live stream later,  so we need to add one more image on the preview screen.

**6.** Click on the "eye" icon besides **Image2**, so a new image appears. You can drag the image to adjust its position and the sizes.
 ![_image2d_](https://github.com/kailinwei/using-OBS/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/task2d.png?raw=true "Studio Mode") 

Let's say you would like to share the two images in your preview screen.  
**7.** Click on **Transition** to switch. Now, the two images from the preview screen move to the live screen on the right.
 ![_image2e_](https://github.com/kailinwei/using-OBS/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/task2e.png?raw=true "Studio Mode") 

There are some selection under the **Transition** button which allows to choose different scene transitions. You can choose **Cut**, **Fade**, and **Fade to Black**.

* **Cut** is instant, it make the switching very fast.
![_image2f_](https://github.com/kailinwei/using-OBS/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/task2f.png?raw=true "After Transition") 
* **Fade** will make the transition over a period of time. You can adjust how long you want the transition to last in millisecond.
![_image2g_](https://github.com/kailinwei/using-OBS/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/task2g.png?raw=true "Fade selections") 

* The **Fade to Black** is similar to **Fade** except that it will fade to black first.

**8.** Click **Fade to Black** , then click on **Transition** will allow you fade the live mode screen to black, then move the preview screen to live mode.
![_image2h_](https://github.com/kailinwei/using-OBS/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/task2h.png?raw=true "Fade selections") 

You can adjust the time it takes from **Fade to Black** by selecting the drop down menu and the time section.
![_image2i_](https://github.com/kailinwei/using-OBS/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/task2i.png?raw=true "Fade to black")

Or, you can manually drag the bar below the the **Fade to Black** to adjust the time.
