# Trouble Shooting #

## Desktop Audio Device in Setting is disabled / No audio output device ##

Download an extension such as iShowU Audio Capture. 
This is because Mac OS does not support capture audio sounds built-in Desktop, so Mac OS needs a second-hand program to solve OBS audio capture issue.

Link to the specific solution :  *[Capture audio with iShowU Audio Capture](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/os-x-capture-audio-with-ishowu-audio-capture.505/)*

This is not an official guideline but it would be helpful to download and set up the audio with the extension.

## Camera function disabled for other apps ##

After downloading OBS Studio, you may be unable to turn on the camera function from other apps such Loom and Google Meet. You may see an image as the following screenshot.

This happens because OBS builds in an OBS Virtual Camera in your laptop. If you do not want to use the OBS at the moment, do the following steps: 

**1.** Select the *Camera* option in the setting of your app
**2.** Choose the original camera built in your laptop.
