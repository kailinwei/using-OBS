# Trouble Shooting #

## Desktop Audio Device in Setting is disabled / No audio output device ##

Download an extension such as iShowU Audio Capture. 
This is because Desktop audio on Mac needs the extension to help OBS audio capture because Mac OS does not support capture audio sounds built-in.
Link to the specific solution :  *[Capture audio with iShowU Audio Capture](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/os-x-capture-audio-with-ishowu-audio-capture.505/)*
This is not an official guideline but it would be hlep to solve the issue.
