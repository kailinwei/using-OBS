# Trouble Shooting #

## Desktop Audio Device in Setting is disabled / No audio output device ##

Download an extension such as iShowU Audio Capture. 
This is because Mac OS does not support capture audio sounds built-in Desktop, so Mac OS needs a second-hand program to solve OBS audio capture issue.

Link to the specific solution :  *[Capture audio with iShowU Audio Capture](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/os-x-capture-audio-with-ishowu-audio-capture.505/)*

This is not an official guideline but it would be helpful to download and set up the audio with the extension.
