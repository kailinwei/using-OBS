# How to use OBS :warning: Note


## Overview of Open Broadcast Software (OBS) Studio Guide ##

Hello, the purpose of this guide on OBS aims to help Mac users navigate and use OBS studio.

The topics we included in this document are:

* Download and setup OBS Studio

* Stream a game live using Twitch or Youtube account

* Record a video and upload them

* Learn how to use studio mode

* Add caption to a video

## How We Collaborated Together ##

This guide was created by Mai, Hailey and Kailin from COMM 2116. At the early stage of this project, we brainstormed the essential information and the steps needed by a new user when he first downloaded this software. Then, we divided the work and combined them on Github after we finished.

Due to the school closure, we used Discord as our main communication channel to hold meetings. We valued communication importantly in this project, so we kept updating with our progress and discussed the problem we encountered together.

## Structure

To build a complete user guide in limited time, this documentation was built upon [just-the-docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) which contains Jekyll theme with built-in serach function. This documentation gave us framework of the document and we were able to provide detailed instructions. 

## Challenge ##

To accomplish our goal of providing a helpful guideline to new users, our group faced many challenges.

Since this document was written in Markdown language, which we never used before, our group members learnt this language first before started writing.

Uploading our writings on a Jekyll themes GitHub repository was also a challenge we met. With the assistance from our course instructor, we were able to publish our work github.  

Since OBS Studio was new to our group, our group  had to learn and navigate this software first. As new users, we did many researches and aimed to provided the most helpful navigation in this guideline.

We would like to invite you read our guideline and welcome any feedback and questions.

Best Wishes,  
Mai T., Hailey K., and Kailin W.
